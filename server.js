  IT POLICIES
  Password Security
Compromised passwords and credentials are the reason for majority of cloud data breaches. Someone gaining access to your sensitive information can be detrimental for your business and cost you your valuable time and money.
It’s simple to adopt a password security policy, all you need to do is create a list which includes the features that must be included in all new passwords. You should ensure that everyone fully understands this and has access to the list. Features that are typically included in this type of policy are:
– Length of password
– Any numbers and symbols necessary
– Where your password should be stored – e.g password manager
– How to store your password
– Using multi-factor authentication (MFA)
– How regularly you should be changing these passwords
Acceptable Use
The acceptable use policy details how data and technology should be used correctly within your organisation. It outlines a range of details which are all in alignment with the security of your IT network that help protect your data. An example of something in this policy could be ensuring employees regularly update their devices.
Another essential thing to be included in this policy is detailing where employees are allowed to use their company devices. For example, if employees are remote working, it is a good idea to emphasise that these devices are for individual and work purposes only and they should not be shared with family members.

Cloud and App Use
Employees using unauthorised cloud applications has become a big problem more recently and this is referred to as “Shadow IT”. Shadow IT is the use of information technology systems, devices, software, applications, and services without explicit approval from the IT department. There is an increasing percentage to show just how much Shadow IT can take up of a company’s cloud use.
However, employees should not be entirely blamed – how are they supposed to know that them using these unapproved cloud tools for company data is a major security risk if they haven’t been informed within a policy?
With a clear cloud and app use policy, employees will have a clear understanding of what applications they can and can’t use for business data. Unapproved applications should be obviously restricted, to make all employees aware that they should not use them.
Bring Your Own Device – BYOD
A large number of companies in Suffolk tend to opt for a BOYD approach for mobile phone use amongst employees. BYOD is where employees bring their own mobile phones to work, and this provides an opportunity for companies to save money. It is also considerably easier, as employees have only one device as opposed to having to worry about having multiple phones.
Although if you have not outlined a policy regarding the use of this, there is potential for there to be various security issues. There can be legal confusion when dealing with personal devices and compensation, if they were to become damaged for any reason. Also, it should be considered, with employees’ own devices, companies don’t know what the operating system of these devices is like and if it has undergone any updates. An operating system that is not updated regularly in line with the software updates is likely to be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
Having a policy that all employees are aware of will make it clear exactly what devices employees should be using and how they can keep safe as a result.

Wi-Fi Usage
It is a known fact that Public Wi-Fi can cause cybersecurity issues – it is a hubspot for hackers who will purposely sit and wait to hack user’s login credentials. A larger number of employees than you would think have previously connected to a public Wi-Fi from a device that is company-owned.
The issue that this proposes is that a lot of employees wouldn’t think there was anything wrong with logging into a company app or email account on an external network. You should be aware that actions such as this, can lead to the hacking of credentials or result in a breach in the company network.
Having a Wi-Fi policy is particularly necessary as it will make sure your employees are connected safely to the internet. To ensure your business credentials are protected, you should also include in the policy what employees can do when they are on public Wi-Fi, with details regarding passwords and card details.
Social Media
The use of social media at work is becoming increasingly common, more and more of us are now actually using it as a part of our day-to-day role. The odd glance at a social media feed here and there can result in hours of endless scrolling throughout the week, which can negatively impact the productivity of whole the team.
This can all be avoided by implementing a simple social media policy. This policy can include a range of details, including when employees can use their personal accounts and what they can post on these accounts about the workplace.

This helps you manage expectations from the everyday performance of your employees.

1. Password Security Policy
Approximately 77% of all cloud data breaches result from compromised passwords, which are now the leading cause of confidential data breaches worldwide. A password security policy should provide guidelines for employees on handling their login passwords, including:

Password length
Password composition (e.g., using at least one number and symbol)
Password storage and management
Multi-factor authentication (if required)
Frequency of password changes
Password
2. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
The Acceptable Use Policy is a comprehensive policy that governs the proper use of technology and data within your organisation. This policy should cover aspects such as device security, including keeping devices updated, acceptable locations for using company devices, and restrictions on sharing work devices with family members.

The AUP should also address data storage and handling, potentially requiring the use of an encrypted environment for enhanced security.

3. Cloud and App Use Policy
The use of unauthorised cloud applications by employees, known as “shadow IT”, has become a significant issue, accounting for 30% to 50% of a company’s cloud usage (source). Employees often use cloud apps without realising the security risks associated with unapproved tools.

A cloud and app use policy should outline approved cloud and mobile apps for handling business data and restrict the use of unauthorised applications. It should also provide a channel for employees to suggest apps that could improve productivity.

4. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
Around 83% of companies use a BYOD approach for employee mobile use (source). Allowing employees to use their personal smartphones for work can save money and offer more convenience. However, without a BYOD policy, security issues and confusion about compensation for using personal devices can arise.

A BYOD policy should clarify the use of employee devices for business purposes, including security requirements, the installation of endpoint management apps, and compensation for work-related usage.

5. Wi-Fi Use Policy
Public Wi-Fi presents cybersecurity risks as employees often don’t think twice about accessing company apps or email accounts on public internet connections, potentially exposing their credentials and leading to a breach in your company network.

A Wi-Fi use policy should provide guidelines for employees on maintaining secure connections, possibly requiring the use of a company VPN. It should also restrict certain activities on public Wi-Fi, such as entering passwords or payment card details.

6. Social Media Use Policy
Given the prevalence of social media use at work, addressing it is crucial to prevent excessive scrolling and posting from consuming valuable work hours. Your social media policy should include:

Restrictions on accessing personal social media during work hours
Guidelines on what employees can post about the company
Areas within the facility that are off-limits for public images
7. Data Breach Response Policy
With the rising number of cyber-attacks, having a data breach response policy is essential to minimise the impact on your business. This policy should outline the steps to be taken in the event of a data breach, including:

Identifying and containing the breach
Assessing the scope and severity of the breach
Notifying affected parties and regulatory authorities (as required)
Implementing measures to prevent similar breaches in the future
Conducting a post-breach analysis to identify areas for improvement
8. Remote Work Policy
As remote work becomes increasingly popular, having a policy that addresses the unique challenges it presents is crucial. A remote work policy should cover:

Eligibility criteria for remote work
Expectations for employee availability and communication
Guidelines for creating a secure and productive home office environment
Reimbursement procedures for work-related expenses
Ensuring the security of company data and devices while working remotely
Network security
Working in cafe
9. Software and Hardware Management Policy
To maintain the security and functionality of your IT infrastructure, a software and hardware management policy should be in place. This policy should address:

The procurement and installation of software and hardware
Regular updates and patch management
Asset tracking and inventory management
Disposal and recycling of old or obsolete hardware
Licensing compliance for all software used within the company
10. Employee Training and Awareness Policy
Finally, ensuring that your employees are aware of IT security best practices and company security policies is crucial to maintaining a secure and productive work environment. An employee training and awareness policy should detail:

The frequency and format of security awareness training sessions
The topics to be covered in training, such as phishing awareness and secure browsing habits
Procedures for reporting potential security incidents or policy violations
The consequences of non-compliance with company IT policies
Encouraging a culture of security awareness and continuous improvement
Implementing these IT policies will help safeguard your company’s valuable data and assets, while also ensuring a secure and productive work environment for your employees. It’s essential to review and update these policies regularly to adapt to the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and your business’s specific needs.

Password Security Policy
About 77% of all data breaches in the cloud are caused by compromised passwords. Leaked credentials are also the leading cause of today’s global data breaches. A password security policy tells your team how to handle login passwords. It should contain something like:

• Password length

• Password creation method (for example, use at least one number and one symbol)

• Where and how passwords are stored

• Use of multi-factor authentication (if required)

• Password change frequency

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
The Acceptable Use Policy is a comprehensive policy. Proper use of technology and data in business is required. The AUP covers things like device security.

For example, you may need staff to keep your devices up to date. If so, it should be included in this policy. Another thing to include in your AUP is where company devices are allowed to be used.

You can also prevent remote workers from sharing work devices with family members and third parties. Data security should comprise another area of ​​the AUP.

You need to specify how data is stored and processed. Your policy may require an encrypted environment for security reasons.

Cloud & App Use Policy
Employee use of rogue cloud applications has become a major problem. This use of “shadow IT” is estimated to account for 30% to 60% of an organization’s cloud usage. Employees often use cloud apps they are not familiar with.

They don’t realize that using unapproved cloud tools on corporate data poses significant security risks. Cloud and app usage policies inform employees which cloud and mobile apps they can use for their business data.

Any IT policy must state that the use of unapproved applications is restricted (and, preferably, accompany this with the appropriate security controls). It should also provide a way to suggest apps that improve productivity.

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
About 83% of organizations have adopted a BYOD approach to employee mobile usage. Businesses save money when employees can use their smartphones for work. It’s also convenient for employees because they don’t have to carry a second device.

However, security and other issues can arise if there is no policy mandating the use of BYOD. Employee devices can be vulnerable to attacks if operating systems are not updated. There can also be confusion about compensation for personal device use at work.

A BYOD policy makes it clear how employee devices can be used for business purposes. You can also insist on the required installation of endpoint management apps.

Wi-Fi Use Policy
Public WiFi is a problem when it comes to cyber security. 61% of companies surveyed said their employees connect to public WiFi from company-owned devices. Doing so exposes those credentials and can in turn lead to a compromise of a corporate network.

The company’s Wi-Fi usage policy explains how employees can ensure a secure connection. You should insist that employees use a corporate VPN. Policies can also limit what employees can and can’t do on public Wi-Fi networks. For example, do not enter passwords or payment card details in forms.

Social Media Use Policy
Social media use in the workplace is so common that it’s important to address it. Otherwise, endless scrolling and posting can cost you hours of lost productivity each week. Include details in your social media policy, such as:

• A time limit for employees’ use of personal social media

• Restrictions what employees can post about the company

• Awareness of ‘selfie safe zones’ or facility areas where images are not allowed to be captured

  HR POLICIES
  1. At-will employment policy statement
Employees are hired and employed “at will,” which allows both the employer or the employee to terminate the employment at any time, as long as the reason is lawful. 

This policy is widely practiced in the United States and may have varying regulations on a state-by-state basis. It is essential to note that while an employer may end the employment relationship for any reason, it should not be based on any discriminatory motive such as gender, age, race, or religion. 

An at-will employment policy provides both the employer and employee with flexibility, and it is essential to familiarize oneself with state-specific regulations to avoid any unfair practices.

2. Non-discrimination policy
A non-discrimination policy is an essential aspect of any workplace. It is a formal statement or set of guidelines that clearly communicates an organization’s commitment to treating all individuals fairly and equally, irrespective of specific protected characteristics or attributes.

Discrimination under the law refers to any unfavorable treatment or action taken against an individual or group based on their membership in a protected class. This includes hiring, promotions, pay, work assignments, work schedules, and terminations. Such practices are illegal and can result in serious consequences for the employer. 

This policy is important for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within your organization and ensuring that the business complies with relevant anti-discrimination laws and regulations.

3. Anti-harassment policy
An anti-harassment policy is crucial to ensure a safe and comfortable work environment for employees. Harassment can be defined as any unwelcome conduct that violates an individual’s dignity or generates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. This behavior can be both sexual and non-sexual. 

The anti-harassment policy should provide guidelines on the reporting of harassment to HR. It is also essential for HR to ensure that employees feel comfortable reporting harassment and that they investigate any claims and allegations seriously and appropriately.

4. Retaliation
Retaliation is a term that refers to any adverse action taken by an employer against an employee who has reported a violation of workplace policies or laws. Forms of retaliation can include termination or dismissal, exclusion or isolation, hostile work environment, falling to promote or any other discriminatory treatment. 

Some countries’ laws prohibit employers from retaliating against their employees. Employees who feel they have been retaliated against can take advantage of various reporting options, such as filing a complaint with Human Resources or taking legal action in a court of law. 

HR must have a retaliation policy in place to protect employees who exercise their rights and responsibilities within the workplace and promote ethical workplace behavior. Enforcing such policies can help promote a safe and fair work environment for everyone involved.

5. Social media policy
In today’s digital age, social media has become integral to business and our personal lives. However, it’s important for companies to create and enforce social media policies that protect the reputation of the company while providing guidance on company accounts. 

In research conducted by Pew Research Center, around half of all full-time and part-time workers (51%) stated that their workplace enforces rules on social media usage while working. Additionally, 32% of workers indicated that their employers have guidelines on how employees should present themselves on the Internet as a whole, with 63% indicating that their employer does not enforce such policies.

Ultimately, social media policies can help prevent any negative impact on the company’s reputation and safeguard against any legal liabilities that may arise. By having a clear and concise social media policy, employees can better understand how to represent the company on social media platforms, allowing for a positive and engaging online presence.

6. Remote work policy
As companies increasingly adopt hybrid or fully remote working arrangements, it is crucial to establish comprehensive remote work policies. These policies help to maintain employee productivity and prevent potential burnout. According to a study conducted by Buffer, 63% of remote workers feel compelled to check emails on weekends, with 34% doing so even while on vacation. An additional 48% indicated that they often work outside of traditional work hours, while 44% reported working more this year compared to previous years.

If your company offers remote work options, it is important to have well-defined policies that facilitate efficient work for both managers and employees. For instance, Microsoft has urged teams to schedule after-hour messages to be sent within office hours. Additionally, your remote work policy should establish clear expectations regarding the frequency of working from home and the need for in-office presence.

7. Workplace violence policy
A workplace violence policy is an essential component of any well-functioning organization. Instituting a zero-tolerance approach towards the issue is paramount, but defining what constitutes instances of workplace violence and what items are classified as weapons is equally important. 

Prohibited behaviors should also be clearly outlined, and employees should be educated on the potential disciplinary measures if they are found to be violating the policy. By having a comprehensive workplace violence policy in place, employers can ensure the safety and wellbeing of all their workers, creating a healthy and productive working environment for everyone involved.

8. Drug and alcohol policy
The drug and alcohol policy is essential to any workplace safety program. It establishes the rules and expectations regarding substance use and abuse among employees. The policy must specify the procedures for testing, which may include random testing, post-incident testing, and reasonable suspicion testing. Consequences for violating the policy should also be clearly outlined. 

Depending on the industry, additional policies may be necessary for CDL drivers and other DOT-enforced work. It is vital to consider special considerations in these circumstances to ensure the safety of everyone involved. 

9. Recruiting and hiring policies
Recruiting and hiring policies serve as a guiding principle for organizations while hiring the most suitable candidates for specific job roles. Hiring and selection policies should be carefully designed, with clear guidelines in place, to ensure that the organization only employs candidates whose education, experience, and skills match the job requirements. 

In addition to this, document retention policies play a crucial role in maintaining complete employment records after the hiring process is complete. By documenting the hiring process and retaining the relevant documents for future reference, employers can ensure both legal compliance and a smooth onboarding experience for new employees. 

25 Critical HR Policies To Have

Your religious accommodations policy should explain the requesting process. This may involve filling out a formal request form, meeting with HR or their supervisor, and providing documentation to support their request. 

14. Discipline policies
The process for employee discipline should involve a well-defined documentation system that outlines the various levels of disciplinary action and their corresponding duration. The aim of this process is to ensure that there is a consistent and fair approach to addressing any employee misconduct. 

Additionally, there should be clear notification procedures in place to inform the employee of the disciplinary action taken against them. Lastly, an appeals process should be available to ensure that employees have access to recourse if they feel that disciplinary action was unwarranted.

20. Meals and break periods
Create transparency about meals and break periods to ensure that employees are well-informed and can plan their workday efficiently. 

Your policy should state the duration of meal and break periods and the number of breaks an employee is entitled to. Not only is it a good practice to have a formal policy in place, but it is also a legal obligation for some businesses. By listing your break policy, you can promote a healthy work environment that values the wellbeing of your employees.

21. Nepotism policy
Outline the process for hiring family members within the same department, organization, or reporting structure.

Pay and timekeeping policy
A timekeeping policy goes over the importance of accurately tracking work hours and the proper procedures for recording them. You can also include a payday policy that informs employees about important details regarding their compensation, such as the:
Proper protocol for when a payday occurs on a holiday
Pay methods
Frequency of paydays
Meal and break policy
According to local, state and federal laws, organizations must provide employees with breaks for meals, rest and lactation. Establishing a policy for these needs allows you to state the restrictions and rules regarding these break periods, including the duration and frequency. For example, companies may require employees to take an hour lunch break daily.
Leave and time off work policy
Local and state laws have specific requirements for leave that you must include in your organization's employee handbook, such as voting leave. You might also review the organization's policies regarding employee time off benefits. There are many different types of leave policies, including:
Leave of absence

Consider checking the local, state and federal regulations so that you can appropriately and comprehensively address this policy. This helps protect employees from any issues that may arise from other employees.
At-will employment policy
An at-will employment policy reiterates that the employee or organization can dissolve their working relationship for any lawful reason and at any time. Most states recognize at-will employment, and organizations typically consider it an essential policy.

Social media policy
Many organizations have begun including a social media policy in employee handbooks so that they can protect the company's online reputation. You can detail the topics or information that employees are unable to post about on social media, and describe the disciplinary action taken if they violate one of these rules. This ensures employees represent the company in a way that matches the company's mission.

While keeping in mind the state laws regarding certain substances, draft a policy that outlines the organization's stance on the use of drugs and alcohol. Mention which substances you prohibit, any testing procedures you use and the disciplinary action for violations of this policy. This can be especially important in industries like construction where drug and alcohol use can create safety issues.
Confidentiality policy
Confidentiality policies communicate the specific topics that employees must keep private. Consider providing examples of confidential information, the obligations of employees and the consequences for violating the organization's confidentiality policy. You can also share how employees might discuss unethical practices with HR teams to protect them from backlash.
Personal device policy
Many employees prefer using their own devices, like tablets, laptops and phones, for company business. Because of this, you might take security measures. Consider addressing things like what personal devices employees can use for work, how you will monitor them and any limitations or security requirements.

Important HR forms
Proper and thorough documentation allows organizations to track vital information and establish agreements with their staff. Here are some examples of important HR forms:
Business expenses
Business expense forms allow employees to track business-related expenses and request reimbursements in writing. This is most commonly used when employees travel for work. You might have separate expense forms for supplies or other inventory needs.

Performance and discipline
Keeping thorough employee records can prove useful when it's time for reviews or when you must take disciplinary action. Document all disciplinary and performance events, including:
Performance improvement plans
Oral and written warnings
Promotions
Recognitions
Performance reviews
Reasonable accommodation requests
State and federal regulations require all employers to provide employees and applicants with reasonable accommodations for their religious beliefs or disabilities. Though reasonable accommodation request forms aren't a requirement, it's in the employer's best interest to keep detailed records of all communications regarding the request.
Leave of absence
Many organizations have employees submit time off requests in writing so that they can track the relevant details, such as the vacation hours used. The state and federal governments may have sample forms you can use for these purposes, like those used for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requests. Companies might also have time-tracking tools to track this easier.
Employee handbook agreements
This form states that employees are responsible for reading, understanding and complying with all the organization's policies. You can have employees sign this acknowledgment when you issue the handbook and when you make updates. You might include digital signature options to track compliance.
Hiring forms
Organizations use forms throughout the hiring process to identify and onboard quality candidates. Candidate evaluation forms and job applications are extremely common during the pre-hire process. Additionally, there are certain government documents that candidates must complete after you hire them, such as a Form I-9 and a Form W-4.
Receipt of company property
You can use this form to document the company property that your organization supplies its employees, such as tools or equipment. This can help you track company property and ensure that employees return the items. There might be similar forms for returning equipment when employees leave.

  COMPANY EVENTS
  Understanding Your Target Audience
One of the most significant benefits of event data analytics is the ability to understand your target audience. By analyzing data from previous events, such as attendee demographics, interests, and engagement patterns, you can create detailed audience personas to guide your event planning and content development.

For instance, if your data reveals that most of your attendees are millennials who prefer interactive and experiential events, you can tailor your event format and activities to meet their preferences. 

Alternatively, if your audience consists primarily of senior executives, you should focus on providing more thought-provoking keynote sessions and networking opportunities.

Optimizing Event Planning and Execution
Event analytics also play a pivotal role in optimizing the planning and execution phases of your corporate events. For instance, if your real-time event data shows that a particular session or speaker received overwhelmingly positive feedback, you can prioritize securing that speaker or incorporating similar content in your upcoming events. Conversely, if certain aspects of the event, such as venue layout or catering, received negative feedback, you can address those issues proactively.

Measuring Event Success and ROI
Measuring the success and ROI of your corporate events is crucial for justifying future investments and demonstrating the value of your efforts. Event data analytics provides you with a wealth of quantifiable metrics that can help you evaluate the impact of your events.

By tracking metrics such as lead generation, sales conversions, social media engagement, and post-event survey responses, you can identify which aspects of your event strategy deliver the desired results and which areas need improvement. This data-driven approach lets you make informed decisions about resource allocation and event budget optimization.

Enhancing Attendee Engagement and Experience
Event analytics can help you identify opportunities to enhance attendee engagement and experience. You can tailor your event offerings to meet their needs and expectations by analyzing attendee behavior data, preferences, and feedback.

For example, if your data reveals that attendees highly value networking opportunities, you can incorporate more structured networking activities or dedicated networking lounges into your event design. 

Additionally, by tracking real-time engagement metrics during the event, such as social media activity or polling responses, you can make adjustments on the fly to keep attendees engaged and invested.

Identifying Trends and Staying Ahead of the Curve
The events industry constantly evolves, with new trends and technologies emerging regularly. Event data analytics can help you stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging trends and patterns within your data. By analyzing attendee feedback, social media conversations, and industry reports, you can anticipate shifts in attendee preferences and adapt your event strategy accordingly.

Fostering Continuous Improvement and Innovation
Ultimately, event data analytics is not a one-time exercise but a continuous learning, adapting, and improving process. By consistently collecting and analyzing data from your corporate events, you can identify areas for improvement, test new strategies, and iterate on successful approaches.

Key Metrics for Corporate Events
To find whether a corporate event strategy is working for your business or not, it is imperative that you pay attention to the right metrics. 

Experts at fielddrive suggest keeping an eye on the following key metrics to gauge whether your corporate event strategy is bearing any fruits or not:

Registration and Attendance Metrics
Track registration numbers, attendance rates, and no-show rates to deduce event popularity and optimize promotion strategies.

Engagement Metrics
Monitor attendee engagement through metrics like session attendance, app usage, social media activity, and real-time polling responses.

Lead Generation and Sales Metrics
Measure the number of qualified leads generated, sales opportunities created, and conversions achieved to evaluate the event's impact on your sales pipeline.

Sponsorship and Revenue Metrics
Track sponsorship revenue, exhibitor ROI, and other revenue streams to assess the financial success of your corporate events.

Attendee Satisfaction and Feedback
Collect attendee feedback through post-event surveys, social media sentiment analysis, and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to gauge overall satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

By focusing on these key metrics, you can gain a holistic view of your event's performance and make data-driven decisions that drive continuous improvement.

Benefits of Data-Driven Decision Making
While event data analytics helps you in effectively tracking ROI and staying ahead of the curve, it offers many more benefits, too:

Increased Efficiency and Cost Savings
By analyzing real-time event data, you can identify areas for optimization, streamline processes, and allocate resources more effectively, leading to cost savings and increased efficiency.

Improved Attendee Experience
With a deeper understanding of attendee preferences and behavior, you can tailor your events to deliver a more engaging and personalized experience, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.

Enhanced Sponsorship and Revenue Opportunities
By demonstrating the value and impact of your events through data-driven insights, you can attract and retain sponsors more effectively, potentially increasing revenue streams.

Competitive Advantage
A data-driven approach to event planning sets you apart from competitors, positioning your organization as a leader in the industry and attracting high-quality attendees and partners.

Informed Decision-Making
With access to event data analytics, you can make informed, strategic decisions that drive better results and mitigate risks.

Implementing Data Analytics Tools
So far in this post, we've discussed the definition, importance, and benefits of event data analytics in building a solid corporate event strategy. But the question now arises: how can you effectively leverage event data analytics for your company’s events? Well, by having the right tools and technologies in place. 

For that, you should consider investing in the following:

Event Management Platforms
Look for platforms that offer robust data collection and reporting capabilities, just like event data analytics solutions offered by fielddrive. These capabilities allow you to consolidate data from various sources and generate insightful reports and dashboards.

BI and analytics software can provide advanced analytical capabilities, such as predictive modeling, forecasting, and scenario analysis, to uncover deeper insights and drive strategic decision-making.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems
Integrate your event data with your CRM system to comprehensively view attendee interactions, lead generation, and sales opportunities. A trusted event technology solutions provider like fielddrive can help you do that seamlessly. 

Social Media Monitoring and Sentiment Analysis Tools
Lastly, leverage tools to monitor social media conversations, track brand mentions, and analyze sentiment to gauge attendee engagement and brand perception.

By implementing the right tools and technologies, you can streamline data collection, analysis, and reporting processes, enabling your organization to fully embrace the power of event data analytics for building corporate event strategy.

Challenges and Solutions
Incorporating event data analytics into corporate event strategy building can present some challenges. Here are a few common hurdles your organization may face, along with possible solutions:

Data Collection and Integration Challenges
Collecting and integrating data from various sources (registration platforms, mobile apps, social media, surveys, etc.) can be complex and time-consuming. 

Solution: Invest in an integrated event management platform that consolidates data from multiple sources, or work with a dedicated data analytics team to streamline the data collection and integration process.

Data Quality and Accuracy Issues
Ensuring data quality and accuracy is crucial for obtaining meaningful insights. Incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to flawed decision-making. 

Solution: Implement robust data governance practices, including data validation, cleaning, and standardization protocols to maintain data integrity.

Privacy and Security Concerns
Collecting and analyzing attendee data raises privacy and security concerns, especially regarding data protection regulations like GDPR. 

Solution: Prioritize data security and transparency by implementing robust security measures, obtaining proper consent from attendees, and clearly communicating data usage policies.

Lack of Analytical Skills and Resources
Effective event data analytics requires a specialized skillset and dedicated resources, which may not be readily available within the organization. 

Solution: Invest in upskilling your events team or partner with data analytics experts who can provide the necessary expertise and resources.

Resistance to Change and Data-Driven Decision-Making
Stakeholders who are accustomed to doing things a certain way and working with their gut feelings might be hesitant to adopt to data-driven approach to event planning. 

Solution: Clearly communicate the benefits of event data analytics, provide training and support, and involve stakeholders in the process to foster buy-in and adoption.

By proactively addressing these potential challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, you can overcome the hurdles and successfully leverage event data analytics to build a robust and effective corporate event strategy for 2024 and beyond.

Step-1: Define the Measurement of Success- 
Before the planning stage of the event begins, it is imperative to decide upon its desired outcome. This will serve as the foundation upon which every other element of the event planning will befall. Hence, determining the objective of the different types of corporate events is essential. 

Step-2: Set Your Budget- 
The next step is to set the budget to keep a tab on the expenditure. This will enable you to determine the scale of the event and all that can be done for it to be a success. Corporate event companies need to know whether your business possesses the necessary financial means to fulfil the demands of the event. To simplify this, it is best to divide your budget into two streams- incoming revenue and outgoing expenses.

Step-3: Analyse Attendee Needs-
An event’s success is derived from the value it brings to its attendees. Therefore, it is best to be aligned with what interests your audience. This can be done by either directly reaching out to them through social media channels, surveys, or by creating focus groups. This data collected can help you better analyse their needs, motivations, and goals.

Step-4: Design Experiences-
Events are supposed to offer an unmatched experience to the attendees. When an event is designed to engage people and aligns with the audience’s values, it has a more significant impact. The best corporate event companies, therefore, try to evoke a sense of recall by offering unique event experiences to the employees and other attendees, making it memorable.

Step-5: Select the Venue-
While selecting the best venue, event organiser companies must choose a space that makes the attendees feel welcome. There are several important factors to be considered when finalising the event venue, like:

Cost
Location, Size, and Capacity
Catering
Technical support
Health and Safety
Customisations


Finding the perfect properties for planning and hosting important events for your company is not always easy. Since these events are supposed to promote the brand, bring the team together, or encourage employees to connect with the leaders; these properties must house the finest amenities like meeting halls, conference rooms, free Wi-Fi, and more. The right travel management solution can therefore help find the finest properties for a business event in and around all the major cities like:



New Delhi

Mumbai

Udaipur

Agra

Delhi-NCR

Cochin



Step-6: Promote Your Event-
In order to get maximum registrations and ensure that your attendees are excited about the event, effective event marketing and branding by a corporate event company can yield exceptional results. Promoting the event helps to convey its purpose while also persuading the attendees of the value that it will provide.

Step-7: Handle Event Logistics-
It is best to consider different scenarios to ensure that every logistical requirement of the event is taken care of. Coordinate all the logistics to ensure the event is successfully executed, achieving the desired goals with maximum impact.

Step-8: Evaluate the Results-
After the successful execution of your company’s event, try to gather the post-event reporting from different stakeholders. Once this data is corroborated, analyse and use analytics to help measure the event’s performance and impact. This will help you to identify areas of improvement and enhance future events.

Event Budget
calculator and budget
The amount of available budget can impact every aspect of corporate event planning, from the choice of venue and speakers to the levels of catering, entertainment, technology, and staffing.

Decide if your budget has outgoings only, or will you be able to supplement it with income from exhibitors, sponsors or other forms of external revenue?

Has this event happened in the past? If so, use the previous budget to establish a baseline but ensure that inflation and evolving needs are taking into consideration.

Figures from past budgets are useful in providing a clearer picture of how much certain suppliers will charge. Use these to ensure you are not being over-charged when you reach out to suppliers for initial quotes.

Every event budget, however, needs built-in flexibility. Unanticipated expenditure is common and supplier costs are often provided as estimates, rather than fixed prices, so it’s vital that an overall budget is managed accordingly, and a contingency fund is in place.

Once you’ve sourced supplier costings, make a comprehensive list of all the budget line items in the event lifecycle, including venue hire, AV, food, and beverage, accommodation and travel, speaker fees, staffing costs, marketing and service fees.

For larger or more complex budget planning, look into corporate event management software suites, which include a dedicated event budget management tool. This will ensure accurate collection of your budgetary information, help you track expenses easily, generate budget reports, and demonstrate the ROI of your event.

Event Objective
Group of people talking at an industry event
‘What is the event’s objective?’ This should be the first question you ask when a corporate event is requested. By gaining a deep understanding of the deliverables that key stakeholders are hoping to achieve, it’ll allow you to plan more effectively and communicate your ideas in a language your bosses will understand.

Once you’ve understood whether the event’s aim is, for example, to build brand awareness, communicate business strategy, reward and motivate, or launch a new product or service, you can then set goals, put the right metrics in place to track results, and determine who the attendees will be, along with their expectations.

When you have well-defined goals and objectives for your event, planning, promoting, and sticking to your budget all become much easier.

Event objectives should be SMART

Specific: What is the desired outcome and when does it need to be achieved by?
Measurable: Return on Investment or Return on Objectives… or both?
Achievable: Ensure that the event objective is something that can actually be achieved otherwise senior leaders will consider it a failure.
Relevant: The overall objective needs to remain something that relates back to the company’s goals throughout the entire planning process.
Timebound: Plan for the event objective to have been achieved between two time periods. This may require subsequent training seminars or a follow-up event to assess the outcomes of the first.
Venue Sourcing

The event’s objectives may also determine your choice of venue. If stakeholders are looking to leave a lasting impression on valued or prospective clients, for example, the venue will need to play its part and deliver a memorable wow factor.

Other factors that will influence your venue choice include budget, capacity, location, availability, and logistics. Having a clear understanding of these event requirements will allow you to shortlist a number of venues, send out requests for written proposals (RFPs) and arrange site visits.

Some venues offer seasonal pricing, so the hire cost may be lower during certain times of the year. Find out what the costs are for your venue of choice on your desired date. If your dates are flexible, you may be able to secure a better deal at your preferred venue.

If your event has a short-lead time, keep an eye out for last-minute venue offers as there are often great deals to be found. If you’re planning an event that’s a long way off, consider those venues undergoing refurbishment or not yet opened. They’ll be eager to secure your business and may be able to negotiate more favorably.

Three Steps to Venue Sourcing
Step One: Find Venues

Know the meeting objectives and requirements. By determining these at the outset, you’ll decrease the search process.
Take into account feedback from attendees. Is this an annual event? If attendees ranked the venue from the previous year poorly, look at the feedback to pick a venue that will resonate better.
Don’t feel alone. Reach out to your team, or others that have a stake in the event to brainstorm what factors are most important.
Step Two: Write the perfect RFP

You already know general objectives and requirements – now define your purpose. Make it clear what this event requires and hopes to achieve.
Get detailed. Give as much information about the event as you can.
No one likes to discuss money, but you need to share your budget requirements. The venue is one of the largest costs of an event and can make or break your budget.
Make your deadlines clear. Give a date and time that provide venues enough time to respond.
Don’t start from scratch. Pull a template the internet.
Be ready to answer any questions venues may have about the proposal or event.
Step Three: Send and evaluate proposals

Using a venue sourcing tool, you can search and filter venues and send one RFP to multiple venues at once.
Assess proposals via the chosen venue sourcing tool or by manually importing data into a spreadsheet
Create a list of any factors that are less concrete – the qualitative factors.
Pay close attention to meeting rooms – do the sizes and layouts make sense for your event?
Compare how responsive and helpful the venues are to help figure out how helpful they’ll be if you choose them.
Now go on some site visits. You should be in great shape at this point. You have proposals, you know that the spaces you’re looking at are within budget and have the spaces you need, now you can look in person.

Event Marketing
Event Marketing 
By building a marketing campaign around your event, attendees and stakeholders will feel more invested and involved. It will also allow you to communicate key instructions and announcements, safe in the knowledge that your audience is already engaged.

Event marketing assets include teaser emails, social media channels, a branded website, and a mobile event app. You may also wish to design and create posters, flyers, pin-badges, and other accessories to keep the event front-of-mind and anticipation high.

A customized pre-event website will showcase event highlights and build on the notion of ‘experience’ before attendees arrive. A website can also be used to streamline the registration process and create a one-stop-shop for accommodation or transport booking.

The design and usability of your event website will be crucial to the success of your event, so make sure you pay special attention to how it is designed and built.

With the latest corporate event management software solutions, creating a custom event website has become easier than ever. There is no technical expertise required, and you certainly don’t need to learn HTML. With a simple drag-and-drop tool, you can build a complete website from scratch.

A branded mobile event app meanwhile will allow attendees to view the agenda, receive notifications of scheduling updates and plan networking. It will also enable you to signpost attendees to important information like the venue Wi-Fi password, sponsor information, local hotel details, or session sign-up pages.

On-site advertising should also be included in your marketing plan, which includes signage, banners, flyers and brochures, and other event collateral.


Attendee Engagement
According to a survey by Cvent and Edelman Intelligence, attendee expectations and needs differ significantly on the basis of their persona, age, and region.

For example, the event expectations for a Millennial from the UK could be entirely different from a Baby Boomer from Germany. To deliver a unique and engaging experience for every attendee, you need to have a solid event management plan in place, supported by a strong digital strategy.

If a corporate event cannot generate engagement, it will impact the attendees’ ability to retain information.

The human attention span has reduced significantly in this mobile-first, digital era. As a result, corporate event planners have needed to move away from ‘death by PowerPoint’ presentations to more innovative session formats that avoid information overload.

Using the right event technology tools, implementing feedback strategies like live polls, reconciling goals and expectations, and staying authentic should all be top priorities.

Plenary sessions should be designed for delegate participation. To do this, find more engaging speakers, use live polling, real-time Q&As, table discussions, and other methods of keeping engagement high and attendee attention focused.

Conference breakouts should be designed to provide targeted and truly interactive content for your audience. A common event planning pitfall is to turn them into mini keynotes.

Two popular formats for breakouts are:

Breakout sessions: This format is generally used for conferences or sales rallies and offers participants an opportunity to delve deep and explore a topic of interest.

Breakout groups: Pairs, trios or small groups of up to 12 participants work together to brainstorm, complete a business exercise or analyze a specific business issue. Breakout groups are also used for skill practice during training and development programs, as well as projects during team building sessions.

Coffee and lunch breaks meanwhile should be designed for networking. So, consider icebreakers, buffet stations and other free-flowing formats and activities to get people talking.

A strong digital strategy will build a sense of community before and after the event. Online communities can be formed via social media platforms or by ensuring that your event app is available well in advance and includes built-in social features.

The week before your event is crucial for building attendee engagement for your event.

In order to keep the energy and excitement going, create a unique countdown in the form of emails or website updates, with engaging content such as quiz contests with attractive awards, a preview of the main keynote speakers or any number of other possibilities.

The big four types of attendee engagement

1) Engaging with content: This means giving attendees the right sessions, exhibits and other activities to maximize learning and the value of their attendance.

2) Engaging with each other: For many, networking is the primary reason for attending an event. By creating networking opportunities — whether face-to-face or virtual, one-on-one or in groups — planners can encourage and facilitate networking and create a more valuable experience for attendees.

3) Engaging with sponsors: If you’ve sold sponsorship at your event, then those paying customers will be looking for real connections with the right kind of attendee — rather than just signage.

4) Engaging with you: Communication is a two-way street, and as the event organizer you’ve got to effectively communicate with your attendees — whether for promotional, consultative or logistical purposes.

Virtual Meeting and Event Planning
Not all corporate events need to be in-person. Virtual meeting and event planning is a great choice for these types of events. If you decide on a virtual event, you will need to ask yourself a few questions. Are you planning on a more collaborative environment? Does your technology allow you to do this? And if it's a virtual event, do you want it to be casual or formal? Is the content engaging? And does your technology support networking opportunities? While the planning process doesn't vary much from in-person to virtual, the main difference will be in the production and presentation of your content, as well as the virtual technology used.
